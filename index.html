    	<h2>Welcome To KidzGrowth!</h2>
        <p>Kids grow at an incredible pace. 
              They surprise us every moment by doing things we never thought they could at their age.
              Knowing the child's strengths and channelizing him/her at the right age will help them grow into confident
              human beings.</p>	
        <p>Sometimes, we expect too much, not understanding that each child is different, and needs specific treatment.
        At times, we dont know the various events happening in the town which could stimulate a child's growth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In our busy lives, we keep searching for schools, places which offer good enrichment lessons, 
        good playgrounds for children etc. Searching may get very troublesome at times.</p>
        
        <p align="justify">So, we wish to provide all the information that you may need to raise your efficiently. 
        Your feedback is valuable to us. Please provide feedback for us to help us improve and serve you better.</p>
